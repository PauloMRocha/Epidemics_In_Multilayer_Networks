# Epidemics_In_Multilayer_Networks
This project aims to compare the propagation of epidemics in complex networks with one or more layers. To accomplish this, we have developed a small framework that performs the conversion of networks generated by the Networkx library into multi-layer networks available in the pymnet library. Additionally, we have created functions capable of simulating the SIS, SIR, and SIRS epidemic models in networks with multiple layers.
